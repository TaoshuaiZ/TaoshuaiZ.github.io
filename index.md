### About Me

I am a master's student at the Visual, Sensing, and Intelligent System Laboratory ([VSISLab](http://www.vsislab.com/)), School of Control Science and Engineering, [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/) (SDU). My advisor is [Prof. Wei Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085379581). From 2018 to 2022, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation at SDU.

My research interests lie in embodied AI and computer vision. I have a profound interest in enabling robots to better perceive and interact with the physical world intelligently and efficiently.
